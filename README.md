# C everyday

Programming in C every day on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@agnlt) every day of my life until I get a girlfriend.  

# Build
Each algorithm has its own folder. When you build the code, an executable will be created in each algorithm folder. To build everything at once, just run
```console
$ make
```
For example, to test the [stack](./stack/) implementation, run:
```console
$ ./stack/stack
```
